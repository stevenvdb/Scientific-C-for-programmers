## The obligatory "Hello, world"

**Goal:** Print `Hello, world` on the screen

**Learning outcome:** Compile and run a C program

**Instructions:**

- Open the Visual Studio Code app via [https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be](https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be) if you have a VSC account
- Use a C environment on your local machine if available
- Create an app on [https://replit.com/languages/c](https://replit.com/languages/c) otherwise

---

Create a text file called `hello.c` containing:

```{.c}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run it in a terminal as follows:

```{.bash}
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

::: {.callout-tip}
You can use another compiler such as `clang` if you prefer, some options can be different.

## Temperature conversion

**Goal:**

- Print a table with temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celcius, the formula is $^\circ C= \frac{5}{9}(^\circ F - 32)$

**Learning outcome:**

- Exposure to variables, operators and loops 
- Correct some common errors

---

**Instructions:**

- The training repository contains files needed for the exercices
  - Download the repository with
    ```{.bash}
    git clone https://github.com/stevenvdb/Scientific-C-for-programmers/
    ```
  - Alternatively, visit [https://github.com/stevenvdb/Scientific-C-for-programmers/](https://github.com/stevenvdb/Scientific-C-for-programmers/) in a browser
- This exercise is located in `exercises/01_temperature_conversion`

---

```{.c .small-code}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float fahr, celcius;
    float lower, upper, step;

    lower = 0;   // Lowest temperature in Fahrenheit
    upper = 100; // Highest temperature in Fahrenheit
    step = 10;   // Increment of temperature

    fahr = lower;
    while (fahr < upper) {
        celcius = (5 / 9) * (fahr - 32);
        printf("%8.1f %8.1f\n", fahr, celcius);
        fahr = fahr + step
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Fix the problems (there are 3) to compile and run the code:

```{.bash .small-code}
gcc convert_temperatures.c -o convert_temperatures
./convert_temperatures
```

## Logistic map

- Simple formula to model evolution of population size $N_n$:

$$
N_{n+1} = (a-bN_n)N_n
$$

- Intuitive explanation:
  - $N_{n+1} \propto N_n$: increases with more offspring
  - $N_{n+1} \propto (a-bN_n)$: decreases because of competition
- Normalized version: $x_{n+1} = r(1-x_n)x_n$ with $0\leq x_n \leq 1$

## Logistic map {.smaller}

**Goal:**

- Print evolution of a population according to logistic map

**Learning outcome:**

- Write your first function
- Learn how to read input values

**Instructions:**

- Implement the `update_population` function
- Read the initial population from input
- Check README.md in `exercices/02_logistic_map`

## Logistic map: solution

```{.c}
double update_population(double current_population, double growth_rate) {
    return growth_rate * current_population * (1.0 - current_population);
}
```

- A function can accept multiple typed arguments
- A function can at most return 1 typed value
- Mathematical expressions should be fairly intuitive

```{.c}
    printf("Please enter the initial population: ");
    scanf("%lf", &current_population);
```

- Input can be read interactively with `scanf`
  - Be careful, you should thoroughly check input

## Logistic map: discussion {.smaller}

- Comparison of two populations with slightly different initial populations ($r=3.8$)
- Initially, two populations stay relatively close
- After a certain time they completely decorrelate => example of a chaotic system
