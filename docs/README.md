## Training materials

The slides are available as part of the documentation pages:
on [this link](https://stevenvdb.github.io/Scientific-C-for-programmers/presentation).
Example code and hands-on material can be found in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/stevenvdb/Scientific-C-for-programmers/).


## Target audience

KU Leuven staff, Association KU Leuven staff, students, externals (VSC) who
want to get started with scientific programming in C.


## Prerequisites

Participants need a basic understanding of programming  concepts and some
experience with coding in C or another  language. Demonstrations and hands-on
exercises will be executed in a Linux/HPC environment, so participants should
be familiar with those (ICTS offers several introductory courses on these
topics).

Additionally, participants need access to an environment which allows them to
compile and run C programs.
- For VSC users, the VS Code app from the
  [KU Leuven OnDemand platform](https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be) is a good
  first choice.
- Otherwise, an online platform like [replit](https://replit.com/languages/c)
  or [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) can
  be considered (these are however not recommended for a production setup).
- Using your own local environment is of course possible, but we will not
  provide support in case of problems.
