# Operators

## Goal

Solve a few operator-related programming questions

## Learning outcomes

Understand the basics of C operators

## Instructions

Complete the code in `operators.c` to

- Write a function that checks if a year is a leap year or not
- Multiply an integer by 8 without using the multiplication operator
- Use a ternary expression

## Assertions

This exercise uses the `assert()` function to check your solution. This function
can be useful for debugging, but should not be used in production code.
You can easily "cheat" the `assert()` statements, but that is not the intention
of course.
