# Exercise: regression

## Goal

- Write a program that reads temperature anomalies and predicts future values using simple linear regression

## Learning outcomes

- Learn how to read numbers from a structured input file and process them

## Instructions

- The file `land_global_temperature_anomaly-1880-2016.csv` contains years and
  corresponding temperature anomalies in comma-separated value (csv) format.
- Write program that opens and reads data from this file, taking care to handle
  header lines.
- Apply [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)
  to predict temperature anomalies from the end of the supplied data until 2030.
