# Fibonacci

## Goal

- Write a program to compute the Fibonacci sequence

## Learning outcome

- Write (recursive) functions

## Instructions

- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by ${\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}}$ and $F_0=0, F_1=1$
- Compute the nth element by using a recursive function
- Try to trigger a stack overflow for large n
- Write a function with the same outcome but without recursion
