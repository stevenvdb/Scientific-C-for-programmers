# Quadrature

## Goal

- Write a program that can numerically integrate arbitrary functions

## Learning outcome

- Use pointers to let functions operate on arrays and functions

## Instructions

- Write a function that allocates an array, with evenly spaced real numbers in a chosen interval as entries
- Write a function that approximates the integral of `sin` and `tan` on the chosen interval
